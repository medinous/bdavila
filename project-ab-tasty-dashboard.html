        <h1 class="single">AB Tasty Dashboard: a redesign project for CRO campaigns</h1>
        <p class="left">AB Tasty is an all-inclusive B2B/SaaS tool for website and conversion rate optimization, personalization, user engagement, and A/B and MVT testing. Marketing, product and tech teams use AB Tasty’s AI-driven experimentation, personalization and product optimization platform to rapidly drive ROI and continuously deliver outstanding user experiences.
        </p>

        


        <h3><span class="purple">01/ </span>Context</h3>    
        <p class="left">In the product team of AB Tasty we use the Spotify agile methodology. We work with chapters and squads. As a product designer, I am part of the *Design chapter* but also part of a transversal squad called *Product Experience,* responsible for the general user experience and delight of the product.</p>
        
        <p class="left">This project was the first one we built together as the *Product Experience* squad, so we knew that we had challenges ahead. For instance, right at the beginning we didn't have a dedicated Product Manager in our squad, which "forced" me to grasp some of the PM's responsibilities side by side with the tech lead throughout the project. The other challenge, but also exciting part of the project, is that the Dashboard is one of they key pages of the platform, where users see, manage, edit and create new content. And because none of the previous squads had any ownership on this project, the Dashboard has generated a huge design debt throughout the past years. </p>

                <p class="left">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Technical debt: migration to React.js was necessary</li>
                        <li>Design debt: usability issues accumulated over the years due to lack of ownership</li>

    <h3><span class="purple">03/ </span>Process</h3>    
    <p class="left">We planned a development cycle of 6 weeks, using sprints of 2 weeks (3 sprints in total). But the entire project took 16 weeks instead, due to some bumps on the way (COVID-19, less working hours, change of people on the team).</p>
        
    <p class="left">The design process started around two months before preparing the backlog for the 6-week cycle with the research phase, where I started gathering existing feedback from clients and conducting new interviews and usability testing with clients, Customer Success Managers and stakeholders.</p>

                <p class="left">
                    <ul>
                        <li class="painpoints">Lack of consistency and clarity on the campaigns statuses: not clear when a test should be played (for the first time), paused or republished (when the test was running and you made changes that need to be updated)</li>

                        <li class="painpoints">Start and end dates of campaigns are not clear</li>
                        <li class="painpoints">The test type icons on the top left are misleading, they look like CTAs more than filters</li>
                        <li class="painpoints">It is confusing to see action buttons and static content all mixed up in the same components</li>
                        <li class="painpoints">Folders functionality is confusing. The folder icon/trigger appears in 3 different places on screen, with 3 different look & feel. The users engagement with this feature is very poor.</li>
                        <li class="painpoints">Clients want to delete tests from the folders and they can't</li>
                        <li class="painpoints">Test ID is very important and it's a common point of communication between the users, CSMs, TSEs, developers and QA. Currently is not very intuitive on how to see and copy the test ID.</li>

    <h3><span class="purple">05/ </span>Solution phase</h3>    
    <p class="left">After framing the problem, I started creating different versions of mockups that were iterated and tested internally, using tools such as Sketch, Zeplin, InVision, Adobe XD and Loom (to record the interviews). I used Sketch to build the mockups, Zeplin to show the specifications to the development team, InVision to create the click-dummy prototype for the usability interviews and Adobe XD to generate animated mockups to explain interactions and transitions to developers.</p>

    <h3><span class="purple">06/ </span>Results</h3>    
    <p class="left">We planned a development cycle of 6 weeks, using sprints of 2 weeks (3 sprints in total). But the entire project took 16 weeks instead, due to some bumps on the way (COVID-19, less working hours, change of people on the team).</p>
        
    <p class="left">With this project, while addressing many user pain points accumulated over the past months, we were able to update the UI, increment small but smart UX improvements (without disrupting the current knowledge that users have from the tool, avoiding a big learning curve) and also launch new features.</p>

    <h3><span class="purple">07/ </span>Challenges and Learnings</h3>    
    <p class="left">This is a very complex project and I am very happy to do it with a balanced team and a very structured process. It's the first time I am taking part on backlog prioritisation and Sprint planning, which means I am able to to contribute with the Design perspective on the process of project planning and management. For example, we added Design review as mandatory step on the workflow of developers and we added the research tasks as part of the project planning, delivering value and results at the end of every sprint</p>
