        <h3><span class="highlight">Context</span></h3>
        
        <p class="left">This project was the first one we built together as a team, so we knew that we had challenges ahead. The dashboard on AB Tasty is one of they key pages on the platform where users see, manage, edit and create new content. It provides a global overview, with access to the most important data, functions and controls. In AB Tasty's case, the campaigns dashboard is also the homepage in the platform, for newbies and power users. And because none of the previous squads had any ownership on this project, the Dashboard has generated a huge design debt throughout the past years.</p>
        
        <p class="left"></p>
   
                
        <h3><span class="highlight">Why we did this project</span></h3>
                <p class="left">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Technical debt: migration to React.js was necessary</li>
                        <li>Design debt: usability issues accumulated over the years due to lack of ownership</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

    <h3><span class="highlight">Process</span></h3>
        
    <p class="left">The design process started around two months before preparing the backlog for the 6-week cycle with the research phase. Inspired by the <a href="https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond" target="_blank">Double Diamond Diagram framework</a> and <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking#:~:text=Design%20thinking%20is%20a%20non,are%20ill%2Ddefined%20or%20unknown." target="_blank">Design Thinking methodology</a>, I focused on the Discovery phase first, trying to collect as many data and feedback as possible before framing the problem.</p>
        
       <!-- IMAGE -->
    <img style="-webkit-box-shadow: none; box-shadow: none;" src="images/01dashboard/Double-Diamond.svg" alt="thumb">
       <div class="subtitle">UK Design Council's Double Diamong Diagram framework</div>
        
        
    <p class="left">At that point the team has already gathered a lot of existing feedback from clients from previous projects and from different team. Therefore, I conducted new interviews and new usability testing with same clients, plus with other clients that that also fit in the scope, in addition to Customer Success Managers and stakeholders.</p>
 
        
    <!-- IMAGE -->
    <img style="-webkit-box-shadow: none; box-shadow: none;" src="images/01dashboard/Tests-Zoom-small.jpg" alt="thumb">

      
    <div class="subtitle">Snapshots from the usability testing sessions that I conducted with Loom. Although I was side-by-side with the interviewees, Loom supported me in recording their screens and their faces for later analysis.</div>
        
    <p class="left">After detecting the main pain points and prioritizing the most critical ones, we decided on the scope for out MVP. We knew the project was big so therefore we used the <a href="https://www.projectmanager.com/training/prioritize-moscow-technique" target="_blank">MoSCoW method</a> to cut it into different versions, so we were sure we could deliver something valuable to the end clients at the end of the development cycle.</p>
                
    <p class="left">We planned a development cycle of 6 weeks, using sprints of 2 weeks (3 sprints in total). But the entire project took 16 weeks instead, due to some bumps on the way (COVID-19, less working hours, change of people on the team).</p>
        

        <h3><span class="highlight">Ideation</span></h3>
                
                <p class="left">I started the ideation process for our MVP + future versions. In terms of solution, I decided it was better to design not only the MVP but the full scope to make sure that the MVP would be scalable. This approach affects not only the UI and UX decisions but also the development process. We wanted to make sure that all decisions we made as a team would be futuristic: making the MVP scalable to embrace improvements and new features we know will come.</p>
        
        <h3><span class="highlight">Prototyping</span></h3>       

                <p class="left">I started creating different versions of mockups that were iterated and tested internally, using tools such as Sketch, Zeplin, InVision, Adobe XD and Loom (to record the interviews). I used Sketch to build the mockups, Zeplin to show the specifications to the development team, InVision to create the click-dummy prototype for the usability interviews and Adobe XD to generate animated mockups to explain interactions and transitions to developers.</p>

             <p class="left">A new round of usability testing sessions took place after the project was validated by the C-level board. I wanted to make sure that the final solution for the MVP was correctly solving the problems we framed before starting the development cycle.</p>
              
            <h3><span class="highlight">Main pain points & solutions found</span></h3>
                
                <p class="left">
                    <ul>                                            
                        <li class="painpoints">According to many clients, it was impossible to know which campaigns are in QA mode. This causesed distress and waste of time before launching a campaign.</li>

                        <li class="results">Previously only the creation date was visible. The solution found was to combine all important dates related to the campaign lifecycle: creation date, when the campaing was last played and when it was last paused.</li>

                        <li class="results">The solution found was to visually separate the static elements from actions. Also, we added contextual actions to be revealed under clicks and hover behaviours, not to cluester the dashboard view with unnecessary information.</li>
                        
                        <!-- IMAGE -->

                        <li class="painpoints">Folders functionality is confusing. The folder icon/trigger appears in 3 different places on screen, with 3 different look & feel. The user engagement with this feature is very poor.</li>
                        
                        <span class="space"></span>
                        
                        <li class="results">Currently the folder functionality behaves like a filter. Therefore I removed the previous folder component from the bottom of the screen and replaced it with a dropdown filter at the top of the table, side-by-side with the other filters. However, the folders management requires a bit more functionalities than the other filters so I created a new component for our Design System: a dropdown list with dedicated actionable items on hover besides a new "create" button at the bottom.</li>
                        
                        <!-- IMAGE -->

                        <li class="results">Still on the same subject, apart from the dropdown component with the mentioned interactions, I decided to create the same interactions directly inside the table, in each campaign individually. By clicking on "..." and next "add to folder", the user can see a check mark on the folder in which that campaign belongs to - if that's the case. The user is free to change that by clicking on the folder they want the campaign to be moved to. Plus, the user can create a new folder on the fly or remove the campaign from the current folder by clicking on the option "Remove from current folder".</li>

                        <li class="results">Firstly, I made the test ID more visible on the dashboard by displaying it under a dedicated column.

    <p class="left">With this project, while addressing many user pain points accumulated over the past months, we were able to update the UI, increment small but smart UX improvements (without disrupting the current knowledge that users have from the tool, avoiding a big learning curve) and also launch new features.</p>

    <h3><span class="highlight">Challenges & Learnings</span></h3>
            
    <p class="left">This project was the first one we built together as a team and, at the beginning of the project, we didn't have a dedicated Product Manager in our squad, which "forced" me to grasp some of the PM's responsibilities side by side with the tech lead throughout the project. All in all, I am very happy to have done this very complex project with a balanced team and a very structured process. It was the first time I took part on backlog prioritisation and Sprint planning rituals, which means I was able to contribute with the Design perspective to the process of project management. For instance, we added Design review as mandatory step in the workflow for developers and we added the research process and its deliverables in the Sprint planning as well, delivering design value and context to the project at the end of every sprint.</p>
