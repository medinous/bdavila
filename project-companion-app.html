        <h1 class="single">AB Tasty Companion app</h1>
        <p class="left">This is the first mobile solution created by AB Tasty, thus the first mobile application developped by the company. AB Tasty is an all-inclusive B2B/SaaS tool for website and conversion rate optimization, personalization, user engagement, and A/B and MVT testing. Marketing, product and tech teams use AB Tasty’s solution to rapidly drive ROI and continuously deliver outstanding user experiences.

        <h3><span class="purple">01/ </span>Context</h3>
        <p class="left">AB Tasty Companion is a B2B mobile application for AB Tasty end users to follow and monitor their campaigns on-the-go. We wanted to solve the problem of users being unable to take immediate action whenever there is a bug or any other critical error on their campaigns whenever they are away from their work environment, such as commuting in the train or away on holidays. This is a new approach for the company because it is a B2C product.
        </p>
        <p class="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Target Audience:</span> AB Tasty users, but more specifically CRO managers & consultants that use the tool on a daily-basis.
        </p>
        <p class="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Product goals:</span> Campaign monitoring in mobility (play and pause), user notification on important changes in their campaigns and account details. This is a first mobile application and we are developing a scalable framework to be enriched with new features in the future.
        </p>
        <p class="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Metrics of Success:</span> Number of downloads, users satisfaction (by survey & interview) and CSMs satisfaction (by survey & interview).

        <h3><span class="purple">02/ </span>Process</h3> 
        <p class="left">We started the research by studying our personas and user journey. One month before we started the project, another squad had done some intense research on our customers in order to update the the three main personas we have as established profiles of our main users. Therefore, we were able to use them on this project to start drawing the navigation structure for the app and the intended user journey for each persona.</p>

        <h3><span class="purple">04/ </span>Outcome</h3> 
        <p class="left">We launched the Companion app version 1.0 for all AB Tasty customers in October 2018. The users should use the same credentials they already have for the desktop app, which means no registration is needed. They can simply download the app on their personal mobile devices. 
        </p>
    <ul>
    <li>The Companion app is currently available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/ab-tasty/id1447135336?l=en" target="_blank">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abtasty.companion&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, only in English.</li>

        <p class="left">The company created a new team to work exclusively on this project. It was also the first project where I had to build something from scratch.
